# nyks
 
Bitcoin light client using BFT - testnet running [forkscanner](https://github.com/twilight-project/forkscanner) and [forkoracle](https://github.com/twilight-project/forkoracle-go).

# Local Setup
To run a local setup, first clone and compile forkscanner and forkoracle and run them, respectively!

* After cloning you can simply run `ignite chain serve` or for the release binary you can use `ignite chain build --release`
